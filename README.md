## To run the game locally:
  * Clone the repository
     * Make sure your device has up to date versions of Python and Node.  
  * For the backend API, please run the following  
     * pip install fastapi
     * pip install uvicorn 
        * FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python, and Uvicorn is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface between Python web servers and frameworks.  
     * After cloning the repository, navigate to the backend folder and run the following command to start up the backend server.
       * python3 -m uvicorn play:app –reload
  * In another terminal, navigate into the “mancala-frontend” folder and run the following to install any additional packages. Do not terminate the backend.
    * npm install
       * Note: Sometimes certain machines might not install all packages. If you run into an issue where the error says a certain package cannot be found, directly install the package.
       * Npm install [package]
    * npm start
